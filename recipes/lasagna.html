    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. </p>

<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

<ul>
    <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
    <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
    <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
    <li>½ cup diced yellow onion</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

</ul>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. 
        <br>Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. 
        <br>Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
        <br>Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. 
        <br>Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. 
        <br>Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. 
        <br>Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <br>

    
</ol>
